# AI Usage Recap per Team Member

**Rohan** 
- AI used predominantly to support the creation of the slimemold.py. Extensive pseudo-code written, which then github copilot turned into a numpy algorithm, leaving doc comments including some of the original pseudocode. 
- AI used to explain project structure and compare the work done by other team members quickly so as to understand code without having to need extensive coding sync during the "hackathon" periods of the project.

**Andrew**
- Used pre-existing NiceGUI templates, fed to AI, as the basis or the app server
- Had AI generate the base structure for the README.md
- All app server css was written by AI
- drosselschwab code all written by hand so as to make sure to carefully match implementation plan, had cursor pass over and write comments and document to share with team.
- All github/architecture related tasks handled without AI
- Had AI optimise the matplotlib update strategy on the nicegui server for performance optimization

**Ijsbrand**
- Had AI convert pseudo-code algorithms (rq2/rq3 .py) into numpy functions, adhering to meta-patterns predefined by other members
- Used copilot for matplotlib plot design and styling
- Repassed over code written with AI leveraged to document and highlight bottlenecks which then were fixed/ignored based on severity

**Ben**
- AI was used to convert the base simulation code to a multi-processing compatible version. The code was verified by running tests and comparing the results to the non multi-processing version.
- AI was then also used to help with debugging a multi-processing related issue when trying to add the suppression parameter to the model. This turned out to be fruitless and the issue was manually fixed.
- Copilot was used to generate the code for statistical analysis and visualization of the results of RQ2 in RQ2.ipynb. This was done by instructing copilot with the desired plots and analysis and asking it to write the code. The code was then checked over and manual changes were made as necessary.
- Copilot was also used to help with writing documentation and comments for RQ2.ipynb.

**Everyone**
- AI was used pretty ubiquitously for matplotlib charts and styling throughout all notebooks
- Cursor/Copilot were used also for documentation
