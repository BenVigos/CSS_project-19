# AI Usage Recap per Team Member

**Rohan** 
- AI used predominantly to support the creation of the slimemold.py. Extensive pseudo-code written, which then github copilot turned into a numpy algorithm, leaving doc comments including some of the original pseudocode. 
- AI used to explain project structure and compare the work done by other team members quickly so as to understand code without having to need extensive coding sync during the "hackathon" periods of the project.
